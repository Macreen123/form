Alright, listen up, aspiring web wizard!
Here's your next mission, should you choose to accept it (and trust me, you do!): I want you to craft a stunning online portfolio, each one on a different file. Think of it as your digital showcase, a place where you can brag about your awesome skills and projects without actually having to say it out loud. Make it beautifully designed using your HTML and CSS superpowers â€“ I'm talking about a layout that pops, colors that sing, and typography that makes me want to read every single word.

But here's the fun part: I know you've got some JavaScript tricks up your sleeve. Surprise me! Throw in some cool, unexpected JavaScript functionalities that make your portfolio shine. Maybe it's a slick animation, an interactive element, or something that just screams "I know my code!"

The Grand Finale: Your Interactive Guestbook!
Now, for the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance. Imagine a little corner of your portfolio, either at the very bottom of the main page or on its own dedicated "Comments" page. This is where your visitors can leave their mark. I want you to build a system where anyone can type a comment, hit submit, and then see their comment magically appear on the page for everyone else to behold.
Yes, that means we're dipping our toes into database territory to save those comments permanently. Don't worry, with your PHP knowledge, you've got this! Think about how you'll connect your front-end form to a back-end script that talks to a database, stores the comment, and then retrieves all the comments to display them.
Here are some resources to help you conquer the database challenge:

Good luck, and may your code be bug-free (or at least easy to debug)! Can't wait to see what you create!
